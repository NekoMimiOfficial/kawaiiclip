# Usage

execute by running `kawaclip` in your terminal

# Installation
Installation is pretty easy. You CAN figure it out yourself but I made a little script.

```sudo git clone https://github.com/NoMoreSyntaxx/kawaiiclip.git && cd kawaiiclip/installer/ && sudo bash installer.sh```
# DISCLAIMER:
For some reason, the config file isn't getting created. To fix this, create a folder called `kawaiiclip` in `~/.config` and in thart folder create a file named `emoticons.txt` . Each line is a new emoticon.

# Hope you like it!

Enjoy :3
